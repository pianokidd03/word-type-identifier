# Word Type Identifier (0.1.0)

Given one word the program will comb through a massive library of well over 100,000 words and return whether the word is a noun, verb, adverb or adjective. 

The program's license permits you to use this for your own projects, so please feel free to take this program and do what you want with it. 

10 stars and i will do pronouns, prepositions, and conjunctions :)

If you find a bug or just want more info concerning this program, give me a shout on gitter (my handle is pianokidd03) or instgram [@steampunkrobotics](https://www.instagram.com/steampunkrobotics/)
